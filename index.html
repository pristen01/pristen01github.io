                   I have always been fascinated by the potential of technology to transform industries and improve people's lives. By studying ICT, I hope to develop the skills and knowledge needed to contribute to this transformation. I am excited to learn about programming, data analysis, cybersecurity, and other areas of ICT and apply them to solve real-world problems. I believe that studying ICT will not only prepare me for a successful career but also enable me to make a positive impact on society.

                  i believe ict is the right field for me beacuse its field which will revolutionarise the world in the future  alot of people will turn to depend people who study
                    ict  and IT engineers  because almost everything will be more computerise and not everyone has the knowledge about computers so i plan to help bridge that gab between
                    the tech users and the non users and help them to the last extent at which my skills can take me and even beyond 
                    helping people with thier real life problems on tech will also teach that person and eventually sets off a chain reaction in which that person will in turn someday help 
                    another person solve that kind of a similar problem and thats what that matters we grow by helping others grow

                    He beliefs and what studies have proven that  incentive motivation either work or it dulls and block creativity and it also narrow  our mind to other possiblity.
                    also higher motivation reward leads to the worst performance while low and medium motiavtional reward leads to better performace.
                    He  also beliefs and what studies have proven that the best motivation are the ones we do beacause its important, it makes sense, its interesting and that is part of bigger and important picture
