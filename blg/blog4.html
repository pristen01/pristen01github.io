    <h1>FeedBack from WHO AM I</h1>
    <p>
        Find some feedback for your PCO assignment below

        Motivation

        I understand the intrinsic motivation to feel an interest towards how computers work, but what made you decide to study in the Netherlands and then choose Middelburg? wat about becoming a software engineer is of interest to you? What made you change from mining and mineral engineering to now pursue ICT?

        Future career

        You mention working at a cyber security company, I would advise you to find  some for your PCO company assignment and see if you can find information on what is needed to become an employee, what the work entails and what type of skills you would need. If that gets you more motivated it might even help to keep you inspired

        SWOT

        What do you need to arrange, learn, organize or put in place in order to not have your weaknesses get in the way of study progress?
